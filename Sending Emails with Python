# Notes: the password you need to use is not your personal password, but instead you go 
# https://myaccount.google.com/apppassword and then generate a temporary password from 
# there(a 16 digit code). For "Select app", choose Mail, and for "Select device" choose
# Other(Custom) and name whatever you want(prefereably something that shows that this 
# is for emaling in python), click generate and copy paste the password into the prompt 
# that asks  "Password: " in the following code; make sure that the app password has no 
# spaces. Remember that you have to run smtp.starttls() because it starts the whole
# process of sending emails
